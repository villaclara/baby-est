This is the Web app for parents to track their kids activities timings. 
Built using .NET Minimal Api as backend and Angular 18 as frontend with PWA. 
### User interface was designedp primarily for mobile devices to have the feeling like you're using native application for iOS platform (my wife can not tell the difference between it and native iOS app). However it still can be used on laptops with big screen but the UI will not be so comfortable.

In our family we use it on daily basis. If you are interested to not self-host it and instead to use already published by me instance of this web app please contact me.

Features:
- light/dark theme
- filtering kid activities statistics for period
- cookie based authentication
- PWA application available to install on device
- SQLite/Postgres database provider
- *from v1.0.15 new activities in Main page can be added while offline.*
